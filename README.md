# Hours to Days Chrome Extension

Convert hours to days by selecting text in a webpage.

Have you been in a situation where you're looking at your leave balances and it's displayed in hours and now you're trying to work out how many days does this equate to? Or just reading an article or an interesting story online, and trying to mentally convert hours into days? Worst of all, the situations where you need to open up that calculator app.

No worries anymore. With the help of this extension, when you see a value display in hours, you can simply select the text, right-click it, and click on 'Convert hours to days'. You'll immediately see a tooltip message with the converted results.

By default, the number of hours per day is set to 8 (in line with most corporate working hours). And by default, the tooltip message will show up for 3 seconds. If you need to change any of these values, you can customize it in the Options page of this extension. Just click on the Hours to Days extension from the top-right extensions group.
